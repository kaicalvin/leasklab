He uri tēnei nō Kāti Māmoe to Kai Tāhu, Ko Eilish Dalley ahau. Kia Ora I’m Eilish and I’m doing my BSc (Hons) in the ENHANCE lab in 2025. This year I am 'Investigating Regulatory Mechanisms of TMEM176B/AOC1.'

I am really passionate about reducing current inequities we see involving Tangata Whenua in science and healthcare, being a part of the ENHANCE lab provides me with the opportunity to be a part of creating change.

Outside of university, I am also a Kaiāwhina Whare at Te Rangihīroa College. In my free time, I love getting in touch with my whenua by spending time at the harbour or beach, but a huge part of my life is my whānau, who are up in Christchurch where I grew up.
