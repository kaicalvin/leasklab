Kia ora! My name is Selina, and I am BBiomedSc (Hons) student. In 2025, I am studying variants in enhancer regions and how they regulate gene expression in polycystic ovary syndrome, using zebrafish as a model organism. My scientific passion is in utilising genetics to help address women’s health inequities, but in my free time I love to craft, crochet, visit new cafés and go second-hand shopping.
